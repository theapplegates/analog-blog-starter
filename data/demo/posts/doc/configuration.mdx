Analog's default configuration file is `/data/site-config.ts`. This file contains all the configurations for your blog, including the site's metadata, navigation, analytics, comment system, and more.

## Configuration File

The user configuration file `/data/site-config.ts` is written in TypeScript. It will be merged with the default configuration file `/src/lib/site-config.ts` to generate the final configuration object.

In this article, I will explain the fields in your user configuration file and how to set them up. Also, you can refer to the default configuration file.

### Metadata of Your Blog

The metadata of the site will be used in the meta tags of the website and may be captured by search engine robots, etc.

#### Site URL - `siteUrl`

```yaml
siteUrl: 'https://example.com',
```

The `siteUrl` field is the URL of your website. It must start with `https://` or `http://`. If your site is hosted on a subdirectory, you should add the subdirectory path to the URL, such as `https://example.com/blog`.

#### Site Root - `siteRoot`

```yaml
siteRoot: '/',
```

The `siteRoot` field is the root path of your website. If your site is hosted on a subdirectory, you should add the subdirectory path to the URL, such as `/blog`. This field is used to generate the correct path for assets, so you may find broken post banners or avatars if it is not set correctly.

By default, it is set to the environment variable `BASE_PATH` in the build process.
When deploying to GitHub Pages, the `BASE_PATH` is set to the repository name by the built-in Action.

#### Site Title - `siteTitle`

```yaml
siteTitle: 'John Doe Blog',
```

The `siteTitle` field is the title of your website.

#### Site Description - `description`

```yaml
description: 'A blog about technology, programming, and life.',
```

The `description` field is a brief description of your website.

#### Site Locale - `locale`

```yaml
locale: 'en-US',
```

The `locale` field is the locale of your website. It is used to set the language of your website. The format is `language-COUNTRY`, such as `en-US` or `zh-CN`.

#### Author Name - `author`

```yaml
author: 'John Doe',
```

The `author` field is the name of the author of the website. It will also be displayed in your homepage greetings.

#### Keywords - `keywords`

```yaml
keywords: ['technology', 'programming', 'life'],
```

The `keywords` field is an array of keywords used for SEO and social media. It is unnecessary for most modern sites, I recommend leaving it blank.

#### Posts Per Page - `pagination`

```yaml
pagination: 10,
```

The `pagination` field is the number of posts displayed per page on the homepage and archive pages. The default value is `10`.

### Homepage

#### Greetings - `homepage.greetings`

```yaml
homepage: {
  ...
  greetings: ['Welcome to my blog!'],
}
```

The `homepage.greetings` field is an array of greetings displayed on the homepage.

#### GitHub Calendar - `homepage.githubCalendar`

```yaml
homepage: {
  ...
  githubCalendar: 'your-github-username',
}
```

The `homepage.githubCalendar` field determines whether to display a GitHub contribution wall on the homepage. Keep it blank to disable the GitHub calendar.

#### Sections - `homepage.sections`

```yaml
homepage: {
  ...
  sections: [
    {
      href: '/news',
      title: 'Latest News',
      description: 'Stay up-to-date with the latest happenings.',
      content: HomepageSectionContents.LatestNews,
      contentProps: {
        hrefViewAll: '/news',
        news: timelineNews.slice(0, 10),
      },
    },
    ...
  ],
}
```

The `homepage.sections` field is an array of sections displayed on the homepage. The default value is `[]`. You can refer to [the configuration file of this demo site](https://github.com/zhutmost/analog-blog-starter/blob/main/data/demo/site-config.ts) for examples of how to set up different sections.

Currently, Analog has provides three section types:
- `HomepageSectionContents.LatestNews`: Latest news section.
- `HomepageSectionContents.RecentPosts`: Recent post list section.
- `HomepageSectionContents.PopularTags`: Popular post tags section.

To create your own custom sections, you can refer to [the implementation of the above three sections](https://github.com/zhutmost/analog-blog-starter/tree/main/src/components/homepage/sections).

### Site Header

#### Header Logo - `header.logo`

```yaml
header: {
  ...
  logo: '/images/logo.svg',
}
```

The `header.logo` field is the path to the logo image displayed in the header. It should be a absolute path from the root of the website (i.e., the `public` folder).

#### Header Title - `header.title`

```yaml
header: {
  ...
  title: 'John Doe Blog',
}
```

The `header.title` field is the title displayed in the header.
At least one of the `header.logo` or `header.title` fields must be filled.

#### Header Navigation Menu - `header.menu`

```ts
header: {
  ...
  menu: [
    { name: 'Home', href: '/' },
    { name: 'Blog', href: '/archive' },
    { name: 'About', href: '/about' },
    // { name: 'Life', href: '/category/life' },
    // { name: 'Tags', href: '/tags' },
    { name: 'News', href: '/news' },
    { name: 'Team', href: '/team' },
  ],
}
```

The `header.menu` field is an array of objects that define the navigation menu items in the header.

### Site Footer

#### Footer Social Icons - `footer.icons`

```yaml
footer: {
  ...
  icons: {
    Facebook: { icon: 'IconBrandFacebook', href: 'https://facebook.com' },
    X: { icon: 'IconBrandX', href: 'https://x.com' },

      href: 'https://cloud.umami.is/share/unndQ4BKaNaABCDs/my-blog.com',
    },
  },
}
```

The `footer.icons` field contains social icons displayed in the footer. For each icon, the key is the name of the icon, the `icon` field is the React name of [Tabler Icons](https://tabler.io/icons), and the `href` field is the link to the social media or other pages.

#### Bei-An Number - `footer.beian`

}
```

The `footer.beian` field is the Bei-An number of your website. It is only necessary for websites hosted in mainland China.

### Pages

#### Team Page Support - `pages.team`

```yaml
pages: {
  ...
  team: true,
}
```

The `pages.team` field is a boolean value that determines whether to have a team page at `/team`. The default value is `true`. Note that only when there are authors besides the default author, the team page will be generated.

If `true`, all authors will be classified according to their folder path and displayed on the team page. You can refer to [the team page of this demo site](/team) for reference.

#### Page Greetings - `pages.greetings`

```yaml
pages: {
  ...
  greetings: {
    about: 'Hello, Bonjour, „Åì„Çì„Å´„Å°„ÅØ, ‰Ω†Â•Ω! Glad to see you!',

The `pages.greetings` fields is an object that contains greetings for different pages. You can customize the greetings for the `about`, `archive`, `tags`, and `team` pages.

The `pages.greetings.otherDefault` field is the default greeting for other user pages. To override it, you have to set the `greeting` field in the front-matter of the MDX files.

### Post License

```yaml

```

The `license` field is the default license of the posts. You can choose from the following 7 Creative Commons licenses:
