Analog support website analytics systems, including [Umami](https://umami.is) and Google Analytics. With them, you can easily track your blog's performance and user behavior.

Now, let's demonstrate how to set up an analytics system using Umami as an example.

## Umami

1. Log in [Umami](https://umami.is). Click the "Add website" button on the "Websites" page, and fill the form with your blog's information such as name and homepage URL. Click "Save" to complete site creation.
  ![Umami Add Website](umami-add-website.png "Add website information on Umami")
2. On the next page, find the "Website ID" (a very long string), and set it as the value of `analytics -> umamiAnalytics -> umamiWebsiteId` in the  user configuration file `/data/site-config.ts`.
  ![Umami Website ID](umami-website-id.png "Find the Website ID on Umami")

If you have completed the above steps, your configuration file should look like this:

```typescript
analytics: {
  umamiAnalytics: {
    umamiWebsiteId: '4ae5ABCD-EFGH-IJKL-MNOP-QRSTUVWb927e',
  },
},
```

Now, Umami will track your blog's traffic. You can view the statistics on the Umami dashboard.

### Add a Icon to the Footer

To make it easier for visitors to access the analytics, you can add an icon link to the footer.

Umami provides a "shard link" on the "Websites" page. You may need to enable it first.

You can add the above URL with a Tabler icon in the user configuration file `/data/site-config.ts`, like this:

```typescript
footer: {
  icons: {
    ...,
    Analytics: {
      icon: 'IconChartDots',
      href: 'https://cloud.umami.is/share/unndABCDEFGHIJys/your-site.com',
    },
  },
},
```

Then, you can see the analytics icon in the footer of your blog (like this demo site).

## Google Analytics

Google Analytics in Analog is powered by `@next/third-parties`. It is a out-of-the-box solution for integrating Google Analytics. Read the [Next.js documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/third-party-libraries#google-analytics) for more details.


## See Also

It is easy to integrate other analytics systems into Analog. You can refer the source code of [timlrx/pliny/analytics](https://github.com/timlrx/pliny/blob/main/packages/pliny/src/analytics/index.tsx), which includes lots of analytics systems such as [Plausible](https://plausible.io/), [PostHog](https://posthog.com/web-analytics), and more.
The analytics systems in Analog are implemented in a similar way, so it should not be difficult to add support for them.
